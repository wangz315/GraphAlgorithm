# AntBroodCluster
My graph algorithm Library. Implemented based on C++/MPI/OpenMP. All codes should be able complie and run on Linux system. You may use the makefile in each folder to complie and run. Note that not all codes are the "camera ready" version. Feel free to modify the codes to fit your project.

## InExclusionGraphColor
C++ implementation of Inclusion-Exclusion algorithm on graph color problem. Please note ```long``` type is still not big enought, be careful of the overflow problem.

## InExclusionHamPath
C++ implementation of Inclusion-Exclusion algorithm on hamiltonian path problem.

## ParallelGraphColor
C++/MPI/OpenMP implementation of Inclusion-Exclusion algorithm on graph color problem.
